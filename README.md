- The primary objective of this analysis was to provide a report to an investor interested in creating a new football team in this league. The purpose was to define the most suitable types of players and define a style of play that could optimise the future team's success. This was achieved by using historical data on match results, team statistics and individual player statistics.

- The project incorporated rigorous data quality reporting. The resulting descriptives provided a solid basis for understanding the game dynamics and performance of the teams.

- Multiple descriptive visualisations were developed to illustrate patterns and trends, such as team goal distribution graphs, defensive performance heat maps, and effectiveness comparisons between featured players. These visualisations not only facilitated the identification of patterns, but also helped to communicate key findings effectively to the investor.

- The project finished in the delivery of a comprehensive executive report and investor presentation, which had the main points of the analysis and offered specific recommendations founded on the data. Additionally, a notebook operating on Databricks was delivered, showcasing the practical implementation of sophisticated data processing and analysis tools on the platform. The project got two key benefits for the investor. Firstly, it provided a comprehensive understanding of the league and its players. Secondly, it served as a strategic guide for building a competitive team in the English league.
